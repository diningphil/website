I'm just a node in the graph of human relations, trying to understand my role in this world by questioning how it is that I got here. But I do it at a different physical scale.


I dare think about the work I do as art -- [as do others](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1571931) -- though I am not really an art person (sigh) and surely not a great artist. But art is fuelled by curiosity, curiosity is the driver of science, and curious people seek beauty. Quoting Poincar√© *"Of course I do not here speak of that beauty that strikes the senses [...] I mean that profounder beauty which comes from the harmonious order of the parts."*


How can order raise from a chaotic interaction of entities?

How are we influenced by processes and people around us?

Ultimately, why we become who we are?

If you'd like to chat about it, either philosophically or more concretely, press one of the white buttons. See you soon =)
